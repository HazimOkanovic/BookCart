Hello. 

In this repository, I have created smoke tests for UI and API. These cases are as following:
- login test
- register test
- checkout test

I have used Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/

There are two dependencies for this project:
- node.js 20.11.5 (it can be downloaded and installed by running a command in 'npm install', or by following this link https://nodejs.org/en)
- playwright 1.41.1 (it can be downloaded and installed by running a command in 'npm init playwright@latest --yes -- --quiet --browser=chromium --gha')
